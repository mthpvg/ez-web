# HTML

In the index.html, there is now a minimal HTML skeleton.

## Changing a title

You can change the string that is between the `h1` tag. And like before, save, reload... `h1` stands for header1. There are many types of header/title from `h1` to `h6`.

## Inspecting the page

In the browser, right click on your title and select "inspect". A panel is opening, it's called the console. It shows your HTML.

Double-click on the string in the `h1` tag, change it and type enter. The change reflects immediately.

You can close the console by clicking on the cross at its top right corner.

## Defacing websites... locally

Go to https://www.google.com and right click on the "Google Search" button then select "inspect". Double click on `value="Google Search"` replace it with something else and type enter. Close the console. You can do that on every websites and impress a friend or make them question this friendship.
